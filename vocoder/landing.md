## Why voice-based programming?
Thousands of software developers suffer from repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. Support for programming by voice has the potential to increase the productivity of developers afflicted by these problems. In addition, it can enable individuals with upper-body motor impairments, e.g, due to spinal cord injuries or strokes, to write code.
